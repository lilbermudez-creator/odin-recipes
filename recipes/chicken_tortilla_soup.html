        <p> Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>6 corn tortillas, halved and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 onion finely diced</li>
            <li>2 medium poblano peppers</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh cilantro stems</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of ground ancho chili</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>32 ounces of Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>4 cups coarsely shredded, cooked chicken</li>
            <li>2 cups corn kernels</li>
            <li>15 ounces canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>

            <p>Steps</p>
            <ol><li>
                <p>Heat 1/2 cup neutral oil in a medium Dutch oven or pot over medium heat until</p>
                <p>shimmering. Line a plate with paper towels. Working in 3 batches, fry 6 thinly sliced<p>
                <p>corn tortillas, stirring and flipping frequently, until crisp and light golden-brown,</p>
                <p>45 to 60 seconds. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the tortilla strips to the plate. </p>
                <p>Sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. Add more oil as needed if the pot gets too dry.</li>
                
            
                <li><p>Discard all but 3 tablespoons of the oil from the pot (donâ€™t worry about straining any 
                    <p></p>broken bits of fried tortilla out). Return to medium-high heat and add 1 diced large
                    <p></p>yellow onion, 2 finely diced medium poblano peppers, 3 finely grated garlic cloves, and
                    <p></p>2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh cilantro stems. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
                    <p></p>the vegetables are softened and browned in spots, about 8 minutes.</li>

            

                <li><p>Stir in 2 teaspoons ground ancho chili, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 
                    <p></p>and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 
                    <p></p>1 (32-ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth, 4 cups shredded cooked chicken, 2 cups frozen corn 
                    <p></p>kernels, 1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to 
                    <p></p>maintain a simmer and cook until the flavors meld, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>

            
                <li><p>Turn off the heat. Stir in 2 tablespoons lime juice. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. 
                    <p></p>Serve with the tortilla strips and desired toppings.</li>

            
                
                
                
                </ol>
